# Plan: MoonBit Toolchain Management (Global, Mise or Nix)

## Goal
Provide a manageable global MoonBit toolchain setup using either Mise or Nix/Home Manager, aligned with this dotfiles repo conventions.

## Steps
1. Check for existing plans related to MoonBit/toolchains in ./doc/plans.
2. Identify current repo patterns for tool management (Mise config and Nix home-manager modules).
3. Propose minimal, maintainable setups for both Mise and Nix (global installation), including update/upgrade flows.
4. Summarize tradeoffs and recommend one path based on existing repo conventions.
